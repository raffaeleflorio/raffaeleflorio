Hi, I'm [Raffaele](https://raffaeleflorio.github.io) and I've been developing software since I was 15.
Elegance, simplicity and clarity are essential, for me, in code. Indeed, one of my favourite quote from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", is: "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.".
Furthermore I'm really interested in computer security. In particular I really enjoy to analyse and exploit binary programs.

I think that knowledge sharing is a fundamental idea of computer science.
